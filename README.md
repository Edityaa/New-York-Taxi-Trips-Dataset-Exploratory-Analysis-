In this Analysis we use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib,Seaborn to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months  of sales data. The data contains  electronics store purchases broken of each Month.

Tasks during this Project include:

    Cleaning the Data
    Analysis of the various amount , trip distance , trip duration etc.... and their corelation with each other
    Changing the datatypes of the columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype, category)
    Analysing the data to find the best time and days of the year for taxi trips
    i have also used various diffrent visualizations to best iform about the data extracted

Once we have analyzed teh data, we move onto answering the business questions.
